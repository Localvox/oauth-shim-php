OAuth Shim for PHP
==============

I build projects that depend on OAuth and I wanted a convenient, open source way to include the handful of classes needed to power OAuth using composer.

Installation
------------

Update your `composer.json` file to include:

```php 
  "require": {
    ...
    "stevenmaguire/oauth-shim-php": ">=0.0.1"
    ...
  }
```
  
Run `composer update`
